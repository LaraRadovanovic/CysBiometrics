# Multimodal Face-Voice Biometric Authentication

## Overview
This project investigates the integration of facial and voice recognition for improved authentication performance.  
It explores how different facial feature representations — **Euclidean distance**, **relative distance**, and **geometric ratios** — influence recognition accuracy, both individually and in a multimodal system with score-level fusion.
